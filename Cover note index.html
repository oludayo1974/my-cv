		<h3>Data management is of great importance to virtually all industries namely healthcare, marketing, military, e-commerce, manufacturing, finance, tech, entertainment, agriculture, and hundreds of others, for effective decision making in the organization. I come in as data specialist and manager in my organization.

		<h2>MY PAST EXPERIENCE AND FUTURE WITH YOU</h2>

    <h3>My data management career started as a volunteer staff with the NMOD-USDOD HIV Program Nigeria at the Nigerian Airforce Hospital, Ikeja, Lagos in 2012. My dedication to duties led to my employment as the program M&E Officer/Data manager for the hospital site. 
My major achievement for the period was my effort in collaboration with my team to ensure the migration of the site’s patients paper filling system to the electronic data format in 2016. I had since managed the electronic system for better informed decision making for the program on site, and also by coordinating managers at the national level.

When considering me for this job opening in your organization, you’ll find a certified and experienced candidate with a strong analytical acumen and technical expertise in MS Excel, MS Word, MS PowerPoint, Tableau, Power BI and SQL.
I recently studied deeper into Information Technology with my on-going certification in full-stack Website development and design course. Added to my skills over the years of my service are attention to details, administrative skills, and multi-tasking among other skills.

My domain knowledge in healthcare sector allows me to derive valuable insights to support informed decisions in a healthcare setting. As a problem solver and effective communicator, I can convey technical findings to non-technical stakeholders, promoting a deeper understanding of data-driven insights. I am also been molded to be a website developer and designer. I am also activated to build organization website and to maintain it. Moreover, I thrive in collaborative environments, working seamlessly within teams to achieve shared objectives. 
Hiring me would bring a dedicated data manager and website development specialist into your organization who is poised to make a positive impact.

I had several on-the-job trainings and earned certificates and diplomas to further equip me for data-related challenges. These are presented in the copy of Resume attached.

<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>

<h3>The scope of data management is wide and can be applied to all organization who value data analysis for effective decision making like your organization. With my years of experience, I believe I will be able to deploy these skills to help your organization to achieve the desired excellence you rightfully deserve.
