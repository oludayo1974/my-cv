      <h2>MY PAST EXPERIENCE AND FUTURE WITH YOU</h2>
      
      <h3>My data management career started as a volunteer staff with the Nigerian Ministry of Defense-United States Department of Defense HIV Program-Nigeria (NMOD-USDOD HIV Program Nigeria) at the Nigerian Airforce Hospital, Ikeja, Lagos, Nigeria in 2012. <br>I term my service as volunteer staff as "occupy".

      <h3>My dedication to duties led to my employment as the NMOD-USDOD HIV Program Data entry Specialist/M&E Officer for the hospital site.<br> 
      My major achievement for that period was my effort, in collaboration with my team, in transitioning site’s paper filling system to the electronic data format in 2016. This transitioning enabled access to data in real time, informing quick and better informed decision making for the program on site and the central level of data management.</h3>
